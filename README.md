# Data Hiding Application Using LSB Algorithm

## Overview
This application implements data hiding using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. It allows users to encode and decode secret messages within image files through an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.

## Features
- **Encode messages:** Hide secret text within image files.
- **Decode messages:** Extract hidden text from encoded images.
- **User-friendly interface:** Built using Python's Tkinter library.
- **Support for multiple image formats:** Works with common formats like PNG and BMP.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter
- **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL)
- **Steganography Algorithm:** LSB (Least Significant Bit)

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter`
  - `Pillow`

Install required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install Pillow
